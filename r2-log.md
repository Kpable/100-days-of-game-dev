### Day 0: August 18, 2018 

With a new perspective on this, I'm excited to give this another try. I will be working through some AI programming by following the book, [Programming Game AI by Example](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Example-Wordware-Developers-Library/dp/1556220782). After that, who knows. Theres a lot of game dev I am interested in.

### Day 1: Log Generator
#### September 16, 2018 

**Today's Focus**: Create a form that would populate the logs for each day. 

**Details**:
	- Created a good looking form

**Thoughts** My initial go at the 100 days of game development, one of the most tiresome parts were the copying and pasting to enter a new log. Not that it takes more than 5 minutes but if i can make it easier and faster to put in the entries for this, why not! I got the form more or less put together, all thats left is to make it actually generate the markdown. 

**Examples**:
