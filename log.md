##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: June 24, 2018 

**Today's Focus**: Learn and implement object pooling.

**Details**:
  - Went through brackeys tutorial on [Object Pooling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdSmKaJvCoA).
  - Looking at other resources to see other implementations to improve usability. 
  - Did a little clean up in the heirarchy to make pools managable

**Thoughts** I've always been curious, never really had a need to implement them. I worked on a shmup for a [Ludem Dare 41](https://github.com/Kpable/Dimensional-Rift-Escape) and I think this would be good to implement in that for when i continue work on it. All those bullets flying around. Plus i think i recall back when i played a MegaMan game, where i could only shoot 3-4 bullets before the first bullet i shot vanished to be the new bullet i fired. 

**Examples**: 

A bunch of squares and circles being spawned
